 # Short description
In my "Space Invaders" game, developed using JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and modular JavaScript files, players control a spaceship to defend against waves of alien invaders. The game is rendered using the HTML5 Canvas element, offering smooth animations and dynamic visuals. Key features include:

__- Spaceship Control:__ Players can move the spaceship left and right and shoot projectiles to destroy incoming invaders.
    
__- Alien Invaders:__ Multiple waves of alien enemies that move across and down the screen, increasing in speed and difficulty.

__- Scoring System:__ A score display that updates in real-time as players destroy invaders.

__- Responsive Design:__ The game is centered on the screen and designed to provide an immersive experience.

 # What I Learned from Developing the Game

__- Modular JavaScript:__ Breaking down the game logic into separate modules helped me understand the importance of code organization and reusability. This approach made the codebase more maintainable and easier to debug.
    
__- Canvas API:__ Gaining hands-on experience with the HTML5 Canvas API was crucial for rendering graphics, handling animations, and updating the game state efficiently.

__- Game Loop and Animation:__ Implementing a game loop using requestAnimationFrame taught me how to create smooth, consistent animations and manage the game's timing and state updates effectively.

__- Collision Detection:__ Developing collision detection logic for projectiles and invaders enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of geometric calculations.

__- Event Handling:__ I learned how to manage keyboard inputs to control the spaceship, improving my skills in handling user interactions within the game.

__- CSS Styling:__ Using CSS to style the game container and score display helped me appreciate the role of design in creating an engaging user experience.

__- Project Management:__ Working on this project improved my ability to manage and integrate multiple components, ensuring they work seamlessly together to create a functional game.

 # Future Enhancements

__- Highscore Tracking:__  High scores are saved using local storage.

__- Multiple Levels:__ Difficulty increases with each level by adding different obstacles and more types of particles that boost player's abilities when shot.

Overall, building this "Space Invaders" game deepened my understanding of JavaScript and web development principles while providing practical experience in game development.
